      Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia
      and Consonantia, there <br />
      live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the
      coast of the Semantics, a <br />
      large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and
      supplies it with the <br />
      necessary regelialia. <a href="">Selengkapnya (link google)</a>

      The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of
      bad Commas, wild <br />
      Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t
      listen. She packed her <br />
      seven versalia, put her br initial into the belt and made herself on the
      way.

      of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of
      <a href=""> Alphabet Village </a> and the subline of her own <br />
      road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then
      she continued her way. <br />
      On her way she met a copy. <a href=""> Selengkapnya (link youtube)</a>

      But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long
      until a few insidious <br />
      Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
      <a href="">Longe and Parole</a> and dragged her into their <br />
      agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if
      she hasn’t been <br />
      rewritten, then they are still using her.

      It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly
